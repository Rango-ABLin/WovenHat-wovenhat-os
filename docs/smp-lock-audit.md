# SMP ownership and lock audit - 0.8.0

## Scheduling invariant

Every task has an immutable CPU assignment for its lifetime. `current_slot` and
round-robin cursors are per-CPU. The scheduler mutex protects task metadata.
`prepare_switch` only selects tasks assigned to the caller; `reap_dead` only
reclaims the caller's non-current dead tasks. Publishing a Ready state before
saving RSP is safe only because another CPU cannot select that task. Migration
must not be added without a context-save handoff protocol.

AP idle contexts keep their original bootstrap stacks alive. GDT/TSS/IST state
is private to each CPU. Timer handlers use `try_lock`, acknowledge the LAPIC
before switching, and cannot schedule while their CPU holds the scheduler lock.

## Shared domains

| Domain | Ownership / synchronization | Multicore boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scheduler/task stacks | Global metadata mutex; CPU-owned contexts and reap | Parallel kernel jobs supported; no migration |
| GDT/TSS/IST | One static slot per CPU | Local interrupt-masked TSS updates |
| Page tables | PAGING mutex; page-frame and COW locks below it | All invalidations acknowledged before frame reuse |
| Frame allocator | ALLOCATOR mutex | Low MiB excluded; bootstrap pages retained |
| Shootdown | Atomic serialization; per-CPU atomic ACK | NMI handler takes no locks and does not schedule |
| Process table/userspace | Existing process lock plus BSP ownership | Not exposed to AP jobs |
| VFS/storage/cache/ATA | Existing locks plus BSP execution | Driver/pager workers remain CPU 0 |
| File-fault I/O depth | BSP-only preemption guard | Does not suppress AP timer preemption |
| Network/virtio | BSP polling and existing locks | Not exposed to AP jobs |
| Terminal/GUI/keyboard decoder | BSP ownership | IOAPIC routes keyboard to BSP |
| Serial output | Port I/O, no whole-message lock | AP failures may interleave diagnostic output |

## Lock ordering and TLB progress

Paging paths take PAGING before the frame allocator/COW locks. No shootdown
handler acquires these locks or the scheduler mutex. This is essential: a CPU
may be waiting for PAGING with ordinary interrupts disabled when another CPU
requests invalidation. NMI delivery allows it to acknowledge without releasing
or re-entering any lock.

The shootdown initiator masks local interrupts before taking its atomic lock,
publishes a generation after PTE stores, invalidates locally, sends remote NMIs,
and waits with acquire loads for matching acknowledgements. A timeout panics;
it never silently frees a possibly cached frame. Local interrupt state is
restored after releasing the serialization lock.

`spawn_on` and `spawn_parallel` are unsafe: AP entries are restricted to atomic
computation and task yield/sleep/exit primitives. They must not call allocator,
paging, file, userspace, network or GUI services; a spin mutex alone does not
make a service safe against preemption on the same CPU. The scheduler uses least-loaded placement without migration.
Existing `spawn` and userspace spawn retain CPU 0 affinity. The release does not
claim that every legacy kernel service is safe to call concurrently from APs.

## Regression evidence

- A job runs on every online CPU and enters an atomic cross-CPU barrier.
- Non-yielding jobs require their CPU's timer to schedule a peer.
- Remote CPUs cache a kernel virtual address; its physical frame is replaced
  eight times, invalidated, and retired; each reader must see the new value.
- The existing userspace/fork/mmap/pager and ATA/FAT32 suite runs while APs and
  their timer handlers remain online.
