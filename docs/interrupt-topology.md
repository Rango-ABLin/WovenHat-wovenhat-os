# Interrupt-controller topology

WovenHat discovers interrupt-controller topology from the ACPI Multiple APIC
Description Table (MADT). The table is only consumed after its SDT bounds and checksum
have been validated.

The bounded parser records:

- the 32-bit local APIC base and any 64-bit address override;
- enabled or online-capable local APIC and x2APIC processor entries;
- I/O APIC count;
- interrupt-source override count; and
- total parsed MADT entries, capped at 256.

Every entry must have a nonzero header length, remain inside the containing MADT, and
meet the minimum size for its known type. Unknown entry types are skipped by their
declared length. Malformed known entries reject ACPI discovery rather than exposing
partial topology. Boot serial output reports the resulting CPU, I/O APIC, override, and
LAPIC-address summary.

The deterministic parser fixture covers an enabled local APIC processor, an I/O APIC,
an interrupt-source override, a local APIC address override, and rejection of a
truncated processor entry.

Current limitation: WovenHat still routes hardware IRQs through the legacy 8259 PIC.
MADT topology is validated and available for the next transition, but local APIC enable,
I/O APIC redirection entries, override polarity/trigger application, x2APIC mode, and
multi-processor startup are not implemented yet.
