//! Minimal kernel entropy source.
//!
//! Security-sensitive subsystems (initial TCP sequence numbers, and later
//! ASLR / stack-canary values) must not be seeded from a fixed compile-time
//! constant: a static seed makes the corresponding sequence numbers, and
//! therefore any values derived from them, predictable to a network
//! attacker. Before this module existed, `network.rs` seeded smoltcp's
//! `Config::random_seed` with a single hardcoded `u64` literal.
//!
//! `random_u64()` prefers the CPU's hardware RDRAND instruction (already
//! detected at boot in `hal::cpu::detect_features` but previously unused
//! anywhere in the kernel). RDRAND is not guaranteed to be present on every
//! target (older QEMU CPU models, some real hardware), and the instruction
//! itself is documented by Intel/AMD as occasionally failing to produce a
//! value under heavy load, so callers get a graceful, always-available
//! fallback rather than a panic or an `Option`.
//!
//! The fallback mixes the monotonic timer tick count with the memory
//! address of a freshly stack-allocated value (ASLR-relevant only in that
//! kernel stack placement is not attacker-controlled) through a SplitMix64
//! step. This is **not** cryptographically secure — it is a best-effort
//! improvement over a fixed constant for platforms without RDRAND, not a
//! substitute for real hardware entropy. Do not use this fallback path for
//! anything that needs cryptographic unpredictability (key material,
//! nonces); it exists only to avoid a fully static seed.
